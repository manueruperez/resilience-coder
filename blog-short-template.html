    The main Moroccan dish most people are familiar with is couscous, the old
    national delicacy. Beef is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco,
    usually eaten in a tagine with a wide selection of vegetables. Chicken is
    also very commonly used in tagines, or roasted.Lamb is also heavily
    consumed, and since Moroccan sheep breeds store most of their fat in their
    tails, Moroccan lamb does not have the pungent flavour that Western lamb and
    mutton have.
